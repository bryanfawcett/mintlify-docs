The file appears to be well-structured MDX, but I notice a few potential syntax issues that could cause parsing problems:

1. The closing `</AccordionGroup>` tag appears to be misplaced and should be moved to after all the `<Accordion>` components.

2. The content after the last `<Accordion>` component appears to be part of the previous section but is outside of the proper structure.

Here's the corrected version of that section (only showing the relevant part that needs fixing):

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="paw" title="Hwange National Park">
    [Content remains the same]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="water" title="Mana Pools National Park">
    [Content remains the same]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="hippo" title="Matusadona & Lake Kariba">
    [Content remains the same]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="tree" title="Gonarezhou National Park">
    [Content remains the same]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="mountain" title="Matobo National Park">
    [Content remains the same]
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

The rest of the file appears to be properly formatted and should parse correctly. Would you like me to provide the complete corrected file? Yes
